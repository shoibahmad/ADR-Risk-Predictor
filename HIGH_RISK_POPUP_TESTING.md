# 🚨 High Risk ADR Popup - Automatic Detection Testing

## ✅ How It Works

The high-risk ADR popup **automatically appears** when the system detects high-risk conditions. No manual buttons needed!

### 🎯 Automatic Triggers

The popup system activates when:
1. **Risk Level = "High"** (No ADR probability ≤ 40%)
2. **Results are displayed** on the main assessment page
3. **JavaScript functions are loaded** properly

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Method 1: Use High-Risk Sample Data
1. Go to the main assessment page: `http://localhost:5000/assessment`
2. Use the sample data selector (if available) and choose "High Risk Patient"
3. Or manually enter high-risk patient data (see below)
4. Click "Assess ADR Risk"
5. **The popup should automatically appear** when results show "High" risk

### Method 2: Manual High-Risk Data Entry
Enter this data to guarantee high-risk detection:

**Demographics:**
- Age: `75`
- Sex: `Male`
- Ethnicity: `White`
- Height: `175` cm
- Weight: `95` kg

**Lab Values (Critical - these trigger high risk):**
- Creatinine: `4.5` mg/dL (very high - kidney failure)
- eGFR: `25` mL/min/1.73m² (severe kidney disease)
- AST/ALT: `285` U/L (severe liver damage)
- Bilirubin: `4.2` mg/dL (high)
- Albumin: `2.1` g/dL (low)

**Comorbidities (check all):**
- ✅ Diabetes
- ✅ Liver Disease  
- ✅ Chronic Kidney Disease
- ✅ Cardiac Disease
- ✅ Hypertension

**Medication:**
- Medication: `Warfarin`
- Dose: `400` mg
- Drug Interactions: `Major`
- Concomitant Drugs: `18`

**Pharmacogenomics:**
- CYP2C9: `Poor Metabolizer`
- CYP2D6: `Poor Metabolizer`

**Vital Signs:**
- BP Systolic: `185` mmHg
- BP Diastolic: `105` mmHg
- Heart Rate: `115` bpm

**Additional Risk Factors:**
- ✅ CYP Inhibitors Present
- ✅ QT Prolonging Drugs
- ✅ HLA Risk Alleles
- ✅ Inpatient Status
- ✅ Prior ADR History

## 🔍 What Should Happen

When you submit this data, you should see:

1. **Results Display** showing "High Risk"
2. **Red Faded Overlay** covering the entire screen (pulsing effect)
3. **Medical Suggestions Popup** with emergency protocols
4. **Audio Warning** (3 beeps)
5. **Browser Notification** (if permitted)
6. **Console Messages** showing the detection process

## 🚨 Expected Popup Content

The popup should show:
- **Header**: "🚨 HIGH RISK ADR DETECTED"
- **Risk Details**: Risk Level, Primary ADR, Safety Probability
- **Medical Actions**: Immediate steps to take
- **Emergency Protocols**: When to call 911
- **Acknowledge Button**: To close the popup
- **Print Button**: To print instructions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Popup Doesn't Appear:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab):
   - Look for: `🚨 HIGH RISK ADR DETECTED - Triggering warning system`
   - Check for JavaScript errors

2. **Verify Risk Level**:
   - Results should show "High Risk" 
   - No ADR probability should be ≤ 40%

3. **Check Function Loading**:
   ```javascript
   // Run in console:
   console.log('Functions loaded:', {
       showHighRiskWarningOverlay: typeof showHighRiskWarningOverlay,
       showHighRiskMedicalSuggestionsPopup: typeof showHighRiskMedicalSuggestionsPopup
   });
   ```

4. **Manual Test** (if needed):
   ```javascript
   // Run in console to force trigger:
   const mockResult = {
       risk_level: 'High',
       predicted_adr_type: 'Hepatotoxicity',
       no_adr_probability: 15,
       top_specific_adr_risks: {
           'Hepatotoxicity': 25.8,
           'Nephrotoxicity': 18.3,
           'Cardiotoxicity': 12.7
       }
   };
   showHighRiskWarningOverlay();
   showHighRiskMedicalSuggestionsPopup(mockResult);
   ```

## 📊 Risk Calculation Logic

The system calculates risk based on the ML model's "No ADR" probability:

- **High Risk**: No ADR probability ≤ 40%
- **Medium Risk**: No ADR probability 40-70%
- **Low Risk**: No ADR probability > 70%

## 🎯 Key Features

### Red Faded Light Overlay:
- Covers entire screen
- Pulsing red gradient effect
- Auto-dismisses after 30 seconds
- Click to dismiss manually

### Medical Suggestions Popup:
- Comprehensive medical instructions
- Priority-based recommendations
- Emergency contact information
- Print functionality for clinical use

### Multi-Modal Alerts:
- Visual (overlay + popup)
- Audio (warning beeps)
- Haptic (mobile vibration)
- Browser notifications

## 🚀 Production Notes

In a real clinical environment:
- The popup appears **automatically** when high-risk conditions are detected
- No manual intervention required
- Healthcare providers should acknowledge the warning
- All recommendations should be reviewed by qualified medical professionals
- The system maintains audit logs of all warnings

## 📱 Mobile Support

The popup system is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop browsers
- Mobile devices (with vibration alerts)
- Tablets
- All modern browsers

The automatic detection ensures patient safety by immediately alerting healthcare providers to high-risk ADR conditions without requiring any manual actions.
