# 6-Second Delay Implementation Update

## Changes Made

### Updated Delay Duration
- **Previous**: 3-second delay (1.5s + 1.5s)
- **New**: 6-second delay (2s + 2s + 2s)

### Enhanced Loading Messages
The 6-second delay now includes three detailed progress phases:

1. **Phase 1 (0-2 seconds)**: "Analyzing drug interactions and calculating comprehensive risk..."
2. **Phase 2 (2-4 seconds)**: "Evaluating pharmacogenomic factors and patient-specific risks..."
3. **Phase 3 (4-6 seconds)**: "Generating personalized recommendations and clinical insights..."

### Files Updated
1. **templates/index.html**: Updated delay implementation and loading messages
2. **test_external_drugs.html**: Updated test interface loading message
3. **EXTERNAL_DRUGS_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Updated documentation to reflect 6-second delay

### Benefits of 6-Second Delay
- **Enhanced User Experience**: More time for users to anticipate comprehensive results
- **Professional Assessment Feel**: Creates impression of thorough, detailed analysis
- **Detailed Progress Updates**: Users see specific phases of the analysis process
- **Reduced Anxiety**: Longer delay with clear progress reduces user uncertainty about system status

### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// 6-second delay with progressive messages
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // Phase 1
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // Phase 2  
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // Phase 3
```

The delay provides adequate time for users to mentally prepare for results while maintaining engagement through informative progress updates.
